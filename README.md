<h1>Typography Poster</h1>
<h2>OneTweet Project</h2>

Typography posters designed using Visual Perceptiuon techinques I learned from the previous lecture. I chose the tweet - <strong>"@Snowden - Can you hear me now?"</strong>

I first sketeched some ideas down on paper to see which I liked best... and which I thought I would have the skills to pull of seems as I am not comofrtable or familar with Adobe Illustrator. (See below).

<h2>Poster 1</h2>

I got my inpsiration for the following design from the poster below of 'The Joker' from 'Batman'. I liked this design idea because the text replicates how Edward snowden is trapped in the real world and relies on the virtual world to express himself and communicate with others. I chose the font because it had many styles - heavy, oblique, hair, thin, strike - and this meant I was able to reveal elements of Snowden's face, as well as giving definition and emphasis to specific words.

<h2>Poster 2</h2>

For this design, I used the Getsalt theory of contunation to give the poster more depth. I used this font because it was simple and coherent and easy to follow.

<h2>Poster 3</h2>

I chose this design to play around with Illustrator and learn the shortcuts. For example, I used the alt drag feature to duplicate the word 'NOW' to give it more emphasis on the poster.

<h2>Poster 4</h2>

For this design, I got my inspiration from the image of the mouth from Ryan Bowsher.

I liked this idea because it could show how Snowden was restricted by speech and leaked documents on the internet to release infromation to the public and is now using social media to express himself online and reconnent. It also allowed me to play around with the sizing of the typography, the colouring and placment. To improve I would learn how to manipulate the shape of the individual letters more to give the lips better shape and more realistic features.

<h2>Poster 5</h2>

For my final design, I decided to mess around and mimic 'The matrix' and this is the general image concept that I think of when I think of a hacker/important tech related job.

<h2>Poster 6</h2>

My final poster idea was to recreate the NSA logo out of the tweet. Firstly, obviously because Snowden released covert information about the NSA. Secondly, if a person outside of the group was to look at the poster, it is much easier to recognise that the poster is about Edward Snowden. Whereas, other posters could take longer to understand the concept based on it. 

The font I chose to use was ![image](http://www-ru.azfonts.net/fonts_images/samples/036/optimaltstd-bold-otf.png)

I chose this font mainly because it was the font used in the logo itself and also because its width of the letters meanth that it was easy to give the shape of the logo definition with colour and sizing to make it appear like an image and not a bunch of letters randomly placed everywhere.

I found this poster took me slighlty longer, but that was because I decided to challenge myself and chose an idea that had a lot more elements to its design than some of the previous choices. 

This meant that I needed to a little help from tutorials to overcome some of the problems that I faced. 

The first video I watched was - [How to type on a path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEij4_Jw13U) & [How to type in an object with the area tool]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alNrZelhJco)

After watching these videos it took me a little time to get used to the concept, however after a few minutes I was able to grasp it and the remainder of the poster didn't take me too long to complete.
